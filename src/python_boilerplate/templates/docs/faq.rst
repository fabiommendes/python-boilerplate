Concepts
========

Why do we want a boilerplate?
-----------------------------

Because time is precious and we don't want to waste it in repetitive tasks. Copy
and paste can go a long way creating a new project, but is tedious and error
prone. Python boilerplate makes it easy, simple, and beautiful.
